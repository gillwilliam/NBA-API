TODO:
- Add a route for getting an array with many seasons of the player or team (arbitrary number?)
- Add more aggregation stats
- Add playoff vs regular season params
- array of one stat over the years
- compare "eras"
- Add fantasy specific things
  - Have a way to incorporate my league and team
- View trends over the season of a specific stat (or stats)


Simulation:
- Create x random players
  - Have them pick the next "best" player
  - Have one player follow the strategy
- Use create matchups for every week
- using API run through the weeks and determine how the players did

Current Strategy:
- find players with the highest stdev away for the non-punted stats
